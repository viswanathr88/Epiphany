    <about><![CDATA[The Brazilian author PAULO COELHO was born in 1947 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Before dedicating his life completely to literature, he worked as theatre director and actor, lyricist and journalist. In 1986, PAULO COELHO did the pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella, an experience later to be documented in his book The Pilgrimage. In the following year, COELHO published The Alchemist. Slow initial sales convinced his first publisher to drop the novel, but it went on to become one of the best selling Brazilian books of all time. Other titles include Brida (1990), The Valkyries (1992), By the river Piedra I sat Down and Wept (1994), the collection of his best columns published in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo entitle Maktub (1994), the compilation of texts Phrases (1995), The Fifth Mountain (1996), Manual of a Warrior of Light (1997), Veronika decides to die (1998), The Devil and Miss Prym (2000), the compilation of traditional tales in Stories for parents, children and grandchildren (2001), Eleven Minutes (2003), The Zahir (2005), The Witch of Portobello (2006) and Winner Stands Alone (to be released in 2009). During the months of March, April, May and June 2006, Paulo Coelho traveled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella in 1986. He also held surprise book signings - announced one day in advance - in some cities along the way, to have a chance to meet his readers. In ninety days of pilgrimage the author traveled around the globe and took the famous Transiberrian train that took him to Vladivostok. During this experience Paulo Coelho launched his blog Walking the Path - The Pilgrimage in order to share with his readers his impressions. Since this first blog Paulo Coelho has expanded his presence in the internet with his daily blogs in Wordpress, Myspace &amp; Facebook. He is equally present in media sharing sites such as Youtube and Flickr, offering on a regular basis not only texts but also videos and pictures to his readers. From this intensive interest and use of the Internet sprang his bold new project: The Experimental Witch where he invites his readers to adapt to the screen his book The Witch of Portobello. Indeed Paulo Coelho is a firm believer of Internet as a new media and is the first Best-selling author to actively support online free distribution of his work. ]]></about>

        <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

        <description>In his latest international bestseller, the celebrated author of &lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; addresses the fundamental questions asked by millions:  What am I doing here today?  and Why do I go on living?&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything she could wish for: youth and beauty, pleny of attractive boyfriends, a fulfilling job, and a loving family.  Yet something is lacking in her life.  Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it.  So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die.  She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal.  While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues.  To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience.  In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening.  She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Veronika Decides to Die,&lt;/em&gt; Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, &lt;em&gt;Veronika Decides to Die&lt;/em&gt; questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal.  Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;em&gt;Eleven Minutes&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Maria, a young girl from a Brazilian village, whose first innocent brushes with love leave her heartbroken. At a tender age, she becomes convinced that she will never find true love, instead believing that "love is a terrible thing that will make you suffer. . . ." A chance meeting in Rio takes her to Geneva, where she dreams of finding fame and fortune. Maria's despairing view of love is put to the test when she meets a handsome young painter. In this odyssey of self-discovery, Maria has to choose between pursuing a path of darkness -- sexual pleasure for its own sake -- or risking everything to find her own "inner light" and the possibility of sacred sex, sex in the context of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.</description>

        <description>From Paulo Coelho, author of the international bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, comes a poignant, richly poetic story that reflects the depth of love and life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rarely does adolescent love reach its full potential, but what happens when two young lovers reunite after eleven years? Time has transformed Pilar into a strong and independent woman, while her devoted childhood friend has grown into a handsome and charismatic spiritual leader. She has learned well how to bury her feelings . . . and he has turned to religion as a refuge from his raging inner conflicts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now they are together once again, embarking on a journey fraught with difficulties, as long-buried demons of blame and resentment resurface after more than a decade. But in a small village in the French Pyrenees, by the waters of the River Piedra, a most special relationship will be reexamined in the dazzling light of some of life's biggest questions.</description>

In one eventful week, each of them will face questions of life, death and power. Each of them will have to choose their own path.

        <description>O livro conta a história de Brida O' Fern, uma irlandesa de 21 anos em busca da magia e dos poderes ocultos. Durante sua busca, Brida conhece um mago, Mago de Folk, que promete ensiná-la através da Tradição do Sol, que explica tudo através da natureza e de suas manifestações divinas. Mas Brida toma, na verdade, como mestra, Wicca, uma bela mulher que lhe ensina através da Tradição da Lua, a antiga Tradição das Bruxas, que explica o Universo através da Sabedoria e do Tempo. Sua evolução espiritual e sua busca pela Outra Parte (a famosa alma gêmea) estão retratadas neste livro emocionante e tão interessante quanto os outros livros do autor - segue contudo, o estilo altamente "místico" como "O Diário de um Mago" e "O Alquimista".</description>

        <description>Immerse yourself in an electrifying reading experience like no other -- international bestselling author Paulo Coelho's "The Fifth Mountain." A stunning novel in the tradition of the highly acclaimed "The Alchemist, " this is Coelho's daring retelling of the prophet Elijah. During the chaos of the ninth century B.C., Jezebel, wife to Israel's ruler, orders the execution of all prophets who refuse to worship the pagan god Baal. The young prophet Elijah, commanded by an angel of God to flee Israel, seeks safety in the land of Zarephath, where he unexpectedly finds true love with a young widow. But this new-found rapture is to be cut short, and Elijah sees all of his hopes and dreams irrevocably erased. What follows is sure to be viewed as Coelho's literary milestone: the quietly moving account of a man touched by the hand of God who must triumph over his frustrations in a soul-shattering trial of faith.Inspired by a circumstance that forever altered Coelho's own life, "The Fifth Mountain" is a testament to the truth that tragedy in life should not be considered a punishment but a challenge of the spirit. Gorgeous in its narrative and unforgettable in its prose, "The Fifth Mountain" teaches without being sanctimonious. This is a timeless story for the ages, a tale of the past that resonates powerfully for today's readers.</description>
